## Example:
![Image of Yaktocat](https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/WQl0knGUCPUnonDgphRGa/31bdf9f93d43d4b75d5598ab01ef61c0/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-spot-2.jpg?w=720&fm=avif)

Let's add some code blocks. Code blocks can render differently depending on the language.

### Example 1:
``` bash
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
### Example 2:
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
